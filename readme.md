- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles for code organization.

## Deployment
1. Apache Server:

2. Virtual Host Setup:
- If you've created a virtual host, ensure it pairs the http://bank.test/ domain with the ROOT."/public" directory.
- If you haven't set up a virtual host, you can either create one or modify the code to fit your server configuration.
